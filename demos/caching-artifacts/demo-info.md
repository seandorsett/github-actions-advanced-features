# Caching & Artifacts Demo

This directory triggers the caching and artifacts demos when changes are pushed.

## Demos
- Simple: Basic dependency caching
- Advanced: Multi-level caching with artifacts and multi-stage deployment

See workflow files in `.github/workflows/demo-cache-*.yml`

**Note**: Run demos twice to see cache benefits (first run creates cache, second uses it)
